## Current Challenges:
As ABC Foodmart prepares for expansion by adding three new stores in Brooklyn, NY, the existing data management methods are becoming insufficient. The anticipated increase in complexity and volume of data—from staffing, inventory, vendors, deliveries, to sales and accounting—requires a more robust system to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. The current system's limitations in speed and reliability could hinder the operational effectiveness and decision-making capabilities of the new, larger organization.


## Objective: 
The primary objective is to design and implement a comprehensive information system for ABC Foodmart that addresses the current challenges and supports the chain's expansion plans. This system should streamline data management processes, facilitate data access, and provide dashboards to monitor key business metrics. The goal is to enhance decision-making, reduce errors, and increase operational efficiency across all locations.
